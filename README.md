# Even Odd 
Even odd is a project where we intend to find maximum possible way to check wether a number is even or odd. The main objectives of the program is;
* To demonstrate that there is not just a highway in programming, there are many ways and it depends on your problem solving abillity,
* To share each other approach to a simple solution,
* To know to what extent can we do for this task..

## How to contribute?
1. Fork the project, 
2. Read the README.md file which consists what approach we have taken so far. Such that, your solution would be unique.
3. You can code in any language, but be sure to keep your code in the respective directory for your programming language. If you don't find yours, you can create one.
3. Code, and create a pull request.
4. And yeah, don't forget to write what you have done in `Our approaches` section in README.md file

## Our contributors
* Niyoj Oli @niyoj
* You too can be here

## Our approaches
* We used simple modulus operator to check wether a number is perfectly divisible by 2 or not in modulus.c
